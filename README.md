## TODO

üí° Feel free to add any idea 

## Getting started

After install package you need to generate [Personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
We need also `owner username` & `repo name`

We will use [dotenv](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv) package for save this sensive keys
## Usage
Create file .env
```
owner=owner username
repo=repo name
token=token genrated
```
```And add this file to .gitignore```

Then Add this code before runApp method
```dart
WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await dotenv.load(fileName: ".env");
  GhSnitch.initialize(
      owner: dotenv.env['owner']!,
      token: dotenv.env['token']!,
      repo: dotenv.env['repo']!);
  if (kReleaseMode) {
    // For report exceptions & bugs Automaticlly
    GhReporte.listenToExceptions();
  }
  runApp(const MyApp());
```
For report issues Manually (from users) check _report method on [`example`](example/lib/main.dart)

If you want to test it in debug mode you can remove ReleaseMode condition
